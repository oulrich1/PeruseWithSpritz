# Peruse with Spritz
### Made with simplicity in mind to efficiently read with Spritz.

## Functionality 
- Users can share text or URL data via another app through share intents.
- Users can therefore open up a web page, highlight some text and share that text with the app.
- It provides a text fragment in which the user can paste or type text to spritz.
- Anything that is spritzed is saved to the phone's local databsse in the recent perusals list
- Perusals can be removed
- Perusals can be renamed
- Perusals' text can NOT be edited
- OCR could be better

## Note about saving the Perusals:
The title of the perusals is limited to the first three words of the text.
If the Spritzing was done on a URL then the text is not saved, rather, only
the url is saved. In that case, the title is set to the part after the web protocol
"http://" stuff in the url. (Maybe the app should just save the text and not the
URL to prevent multiple spritz web scrapes?)

## Todo:
- PDF Support
- E-Pub Support
- Perusal Sharing
- Filtering for OCR
- Wearable Spritz Views. If wearable is present, send text data to the watch instead on "Spritz"
